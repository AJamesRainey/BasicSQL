# Overview

I did SQL over 2 years ago and almost forget everything. I forgot how challenging SQL can be when you get into more advanced queries. I wanted to experiment with conditional or mass insert statements.

# Relational Database

This program creates a table of store locations called stores, which is then inserted into, modified, removed from, and queried. 

There is only one table, which contains two columns at first. A third column is added later. 

# Development Environment

IDE: Visual Studio Code
Language: Python (w/ sqlite3)

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* Accomplish my mass insert statement, which I left inside the code
* Accomplish my insertion into the in_idaho column based on whether the location column entry contains ID
* Incorporate another table and experiment with joins
